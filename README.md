# How it works
This mod allows you to repair chemical boots at the mill, costing 2 scrap lead and 1 leather. If the boots are worn out, it will cost double to repair them.

# Thanks
I used DigitalzombieTLD's github repo located here: https://github.com/DigitalzombieTLD/CanneryManufacturingDLC/ to make most of this code.
